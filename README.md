# The Task

Showcase your skills by creating an employee directory web application that’s comprised of a front and back end built using modern tools. Include names, pictures, job titles, and anything else you see fit. Go as deep with the front end and back end as you desire. For example, if you’re primarily a front end developer, you could use an API mocking tool. If you’re primarily a back end developer, you could focus on implementing search or modern API standards like GraphQL or JSON API.
At Postlight, we value code quality and readability along with functional code. The code submitted should be production quality and something you would use in a real application.
**We don’t expect you to complete every suggested feature below.**

### Suggested Features
- Setup instructions and notes on how you built the application.
- Use of a front end framework, ideally React.
- Modern API, we commonly use Node in-house.
- Ability to display employees by department, title, location, etc.
- Use of a client-side router.
- Creative use of animation.
- Paginated lists.
- Forms for creating, updating, and deleting employees.
- Source data from a third party person API, such as https://randomuser.me or http://uifaces.com.
- Ability to search for employees.
- Testing.
